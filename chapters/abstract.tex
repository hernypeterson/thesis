\chapter{Abstract}
Numerous lava flows at the summit of the martian volcano Olympus Mons are topographically ``discordant''---they point in a direction other than downhill. If they originally flowed downhill, the underlying surface must have subsequently deformed to its current state. Starting with this assumption, I develop a new method for estimating net surface attitude change from discordant features. I then compare the spatial distribution of implied net attitude change with the surface response to pressure change in a modeled subsurface magma reservoir for an array of possible locations. After identifying the most plausible reservoir center locations, I determine the configurations of depth, radius, aspect ratio, and pressure change most consistent with the discordant features at the surface. The distribution of discordant flows is consistent with caldera-collapse-associated deflation centered at the eastern caldera rim, not subsequent inflation within the summit south of the caldera complex as proposed by \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019}. \textcite{chadwick_late_2015} estimate \qtyrange{1.33e5}{1.35e6}{\km\cubed} of volcanic material incorporated in the edifice during the Late Amazonian, plausible reservoirs identified here account for 0.5\% to 12\% of this volume.
