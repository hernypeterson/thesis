\chapter{Abstract}
The martian volcano Olympus Mons records billions of years of eruptive and intrusive magmatism, with considerable evidence for activity in the last few hundred million years. Ongoing studies of the well-preserved edifice promise untold insights into Martian interior and surface evolution, as well as major volcanic processes like caldera-forming eruptions that shape life on Earth. With only limited satellite-derived data available, researchers are continually looking for ways to derive new insight from existing datasets. In this thesis, I develop and implement a new method for estimating conditions of reservoir pressure change to account for lava flows on the surface which appear not to have flowed downhill.
