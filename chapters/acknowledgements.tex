\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Dr.\ Eric Grosfils for his insightful guidance on this project and throughout my time at Pomona College.

I would also like to thank my academic advisor Dr.\ Masha Prokopenko.

Finally, I have to thank the thousands of documentation authors, StackOverflow contributors, YouTube tutorial creators, blog writers, and other online educators who have all unknowingly made this work possible.
