I would like to express my thanks to several people for making possible this research and the rest of my experience at Pomona College. 

First, to my thesis advisor Dr.\ Eric Grosfils for his insightful guidance on this project and throughout my time at Pomona College. To two additional collaborators, Dr.\ John Chadwick (College of Charleston) for introducing me to the discordant mapping method, and Dr.\ Patrick McGovern (Lunar and Planetary Institute) for providing paleo-topography data used for numerical modeling. To Isabel Fajardo for her patience, attention, and willingness to answer my daily stream of ``what do you think of this picture?'' questions.

To my academic advisor Dr.\ Maria Prokopenko, whose instruction, research projects, and guidance have greatly enriched my time at Pomona College. To my classmates, professors, and the faculty of the Pomona College geology department. To the 5C dining hall staff for keeping my fueled on grain bowls and tofu scramble for most of the last four years.

Finally, to the thousands of documentation authors, StackOverflow contributors, YouTube tutorial creators, blog writers, and other online educators who taught me everything I know about the Python programming language and the \LaTeX{} typesetting system I used to prepare this thesis.
