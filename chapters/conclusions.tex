\chapter{Conclusions}

In this thesis I develop a geometric framework for estimating the location (both horizontal and vertical) and inflation energy of magma reservoir pressure change implied by topographically discordant lava features at the surface. I focus primarily on justifying this method both mathematically and physically, paying particular attention to several simplifying assumptions that allow the analysis to proceed. Preliminary results from this method are intended as an early but promising proof-of-concept, with significant challenges still requiring careful attention before volcanological insight can be derived with any confidence.
