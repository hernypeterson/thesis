\chapter{Conclusions}

In this thesis I develop a method for estimating the location and inflation energy of magma reservoir pressure to explain surface deformation implied by topographically discordant lava features. I focus on justifying this method on mathematical and physical grounds, paying particular attention to the impact of simplifying assumptions applied throughout the process.
