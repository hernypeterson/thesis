\chapter{Conclusions}

In this thesis I develop a geometric framework for estimating the location and inflation energy of magma reservoir pressure to explain surface deformation implied by topographically discordant lava features. I focus on justifying this method on mathematical and physical grounds, paying particular attention to the impact of simplifying assumptions applied throughout the process. Preliminary results from this method are intended as an early but promising proof-of-concept, with significant challenges still requiring careful attention before volcanological insight can be derived with confidence.
