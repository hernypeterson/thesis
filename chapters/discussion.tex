\chapter{Discussion}\label{cha:discussion}

In this chapter I first return to the guiding questions presented in Section~\ref{sec:research-questions}, focusing on how each one informs the choice of methods and the interpretation of results. Next, I compare key findings from this thesis with previous interpretations of the volcanic system. Finally, I discuss possibilities for future work refining this method and applying it to other volcanic systems. 

\emph{Are discordant lava features consistent with surface deformation resulting from magma reservoir pressure change?} The majority of novel methods in this thesis are designed to address the nuances of this question. After showing that surface attitude change (tilt) links mapped discordant features to modeled reservoir pressure change, I soon encounter an issue inherent to the dataset: discordant features do not imply a unique quantitative tilt estimate. A plausible set of simplifying assumptions (Section~\ref{sec:considerations}) reduces this intractable tilt problem to a calculation whose result depends only on the position of an inflation/deflation center relative to the discordant feature (Section~\ref{sec:tilt-from-map}, esp. Figure~\ref{fig:tilt-example}). If an individual tilt calculation depends on inflation center position, so too does the spatial distribution of tilt implied by a larger population of discordant features.

Thus to answer the originally posed question, one could simply assume an inflation center position based on independent measurements and calculate the implied tilt for all samples. However, the resulting spatial distribution of tilt can only be as confident as the assumptions used to determine the inflation center. Since inflation center position itself is a crucial variable to assess, I instead choose to test a large array of center candidates. I evaluate each candidate by the degree to which its associated distribution of surface tilt is consistent with magma reservoir pressure change. In other words, I address the posed question not with an immediate answer but with a \emph{process} for reaching the most confident affirmative answer possible.

The results presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:results} (esp. Figures~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-all},~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-abc}, and~\ref{fig:rmse-abc}) confirm the importance of this open-ended approach. The most obvious location to select as a site of subsurface pressure change is the caldera complex center---a clear sign of significant depressurization observed in countless volcanic systems across the terrestrial planets. Given the topography of Olympus Mons, an additional candidate to assess is the southern summit region. For instance, \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019} hypothesize that inflation centered in this region is responsible for nearby discordant features. However, I ultimately show that the caldera complex center is unsuitable for explaining discordance due to the orientation of the flows radially away from it: pressure change from this center essentially cannot produce quantifiable discordance for the bulk of flows in the region (Figure~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-all}). And, while the southern summit is also a plausible inflation center (Figures~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-abc} and~\ref{fig:rmse-abc}, as suggested by \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019}), it is ultimately less consistent with the discordance data than the regions east of the caldera center (Regions 1 and 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:rmse-abc}). This finding would likely have been missed under a more restricted \emph{a priori} inflation center selection. 

\emph{What subsurface pressure change event(s) best explain(s) the discordant features?} While the methods used in this thesis are largely new, this guiding question is not. As previously mentioned, \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019} argue that inflation of the southern summit is the best explanation for the discordant features southeast of the caldera rim. Figure~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-abc} lends some support to this interpretation: this southern summit region captures the southeast discordant features well, but the eastern caldera region does better. Results in Figure~\ref{fig:rmse-abc} initially appear even more favorable for the southern summit hypothesis: this region consistently shows the best fit (as inferred from low \acs{RMSE}) with a consistent inflation (positive \acs{epv}) signal. However, careful inspection of the underlying tilt-distance datasets (Figures~\ref{fig:region1-analytical},~\ref{fig:region2-analytical}, and~\ref{fig:region34-analytical}) reveals that this goodness of fit is largely due to the smaller population of tiltable/offset samples, not a more convincing tilt signature. Ultimately, the southern inflation hypothesis is less consistent with the discordant flows than a deflation event centered in or near the eastern caldera rim.

Fitting numerical tilt results to a promising center candidate in the eastern caldera rim region quickly reveals what this method can and cannot say about the underlying reservoir. Depth and underpressure (whether expressed in \unit{\mega\Pa}, $pmult$, or \acs{epv}) are difficult to disentangle from one another; deep high-pressure-change events yield similar surface tilt signatures as shallow low-pressure-change events. However, reservoir size and shape are well constrained regardless of depth/underpressure: the reservoir size in map view is comparable to the caldera complex itself (although offset), and highly oblate.

\textcite{zuber_caldera_1992} constrain reservoir depth based on tectonic features in the caldera floor, but show that such features are insensitive to reservoir aspect ratio and pressure change during caldera collapse initiation. Numerical results from this thesis complement those findings in two ways. 

First, their maximum depth estimate of \qty{16}{\km} to the top of the reservoir is slightly shallower than the ``medium'' reservoir shown in Figure~\ref{fig:486-numerical-fits}. The correlation between depth and pressure change shown in this thesis suggests a corresponding maximum underpressure of roughly \qty{-145}{\mega\Pa}.  

Second, reservoir aspect ratio is difficult to constrain using tectonic features, but influences surface tilt more than any other parameter tested in this thesis. Results consistently converged on a ratio of 0.04 among an array of values as high as 1.0 and as low as 0.02. 

Returning to the edifice scale, \textcite{chadwick_late_2015} use flexural loading models to estimate that \qtyrange{1.33e5}{1.35e6}{\km\cubed} of magma was incorporated within the edifice of Olympus Mons during the Late Amazonian. However, large-scale loading models cannot discern the spatial distribution of this material within the edifice. Thus the relationship between edifice-scale magma supply and eruptibility remains unknown. Plausible reservoirs identified here suggest that 0.5\% to 12\% of this volume estimate is located within or just below (within a few km) the edifice. Most of the magma thus remains to be accounted for. It may have been transported laterally to cool internally or erupt at the edifice flanks. It may have underplated the edifice more broadly which would explain the lack of localized, differential surface displacement that leads to discordant lava features. Just as likely, magma may be accumulated right at the center of the caldera complex---the ``blind spot'' for the discordance method due to the radial orientation of most lava flows and channels (Figure~\ref{fig:tiltable-offset-all}).

It's worth emphasizing, however, that these model results, e.g. the footprints in Figure~\ref{fig:reservoir-footprint}, do not necessarily represent actual reservoirs. Instead, they represent the relationship between the actual reservoir and the discordant samples in question. The center position identified on the eastern caldera rim may suggest that a greater volume of magma evacuated from this region of a reservoir more centrally located below the caldera complex. Also note that the radius of this reservoir footprint should not be interpreted as uniform in every direction, since it was calculated to explain only the discordant features which occur south of the inflation center.

\section{Future Refinements}

This thesis is a proof-of-concept for an array of new methods, particularly the calculation of tilt necessary to explain a discordant sample about an axis imposed by a particular inflation center. To carry out this calculation, it is necessary to sample an array of points from each discordant linear feature. In map view, it is typically easy to visually interpolate the linear features simply by examining the sampled points (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:samples}) with the sampling interval (\samplinginterval). However, this visual interpolation is more difficult in the tilt-distance datasets (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:region1-analytical}). In future applications of this method, a finer sampling interval would make it easier to examine individual linear features within tilt-distance space. One benefit of this approach would be the ability to perform analytical or numerical tilt-solution fitting on individual flows rather than populations of several flows. This would address an issue present in the current iteration, that flows within the populations analyzed here may not be contemporaneous despite their spatial proximity and visual similarity.

Regardless of the sampling interval, there is also room for significant expansion in the method for calculating tilt from mapped discordant features. The upper-hemisphere orthographic projection used throughout this thesis conveniently depicts tilt-paths swept through attitude space (about any horizontal tilt axis) as straight lines within a unit circle. This reduces the tilt calculation from angular distance to cartesian distance, up to a simple transformation in Equation~\eqref{eq:tilt-from-map}. Crucially, the orientation of these straight lines within the projected diagrams corresponds to the direction toward/away from the inflation center responsible for tilt (Figures~\ref{fig:tilt-from-map} and~\ref{fig:tilt-example}). In this thesis I consider only a single tilt event, i.e., the net attitude change between emplacement and modern observation. However, the complex asymmetric history evident at the summit of Olympus Mons suggests that discordant features are unlikely to be fully explained by a single inflation event. The aforementioned attitude representation in this thesis is suitable for incorporating the superposition of multiple tilt events corresponding to different tilt axes, as long as each one is horizontal. Qualitatively, this extension is as simple as drawing two straight lines in the orthographic projection rather than just one (Figure~\ref{fig:multiple-tilt}). Quantitatively, it would be important to independently assess plausible inflation center positions, paleo-slopes, etc., but the central tilt calculation given by Equation~\eqref{eq:tilt-from-map} would still apply.

For this study area, one logical application of this method would be to assume two pressure change centers: one within the caldera complex and one within the southern summit as suggested by \textcite{mouginis-mark_late-stage_2019}. Future work could also target centers corresponding to the various patera floors within the caldera complex. Combined tilt estimates may confirm the dominance of the single center identified in this thesis or reveal additional insight into a complex asymmetric magmatic system in the subsurface.

The methods used in this thesis could be adapted to assess the effect of two or more successive tilt events from different inflation centers. I have considered only single straight-line paths between paleo- and modern attitudes, but any sequence of straight-line segments (blue) represents the combination of a sequence of tilt events about horizontal tilt axes.

While I use a simplified ellipsoidal reservoir in an elastic medium, the tilt-based calculations in this thesis are indifferent to the physical processes responsible for surface deformation. Any numerical surface displacement solution can be converted to a tilt solution via Equation~\eqref{eq:tilt-from-model}; the same is true for analytical displacement solutions via Equation~\eqref{eq:analytical-tilt}. Similarly, any analytical tilt solution or array of numerical solutions can be fit to a particular map-derived tilt-distance dataset using the processes described in this thesis. For instance, recall that late Amazonian volcanism at Olympus Mons likely spans hundreds of millions of years \parencite{neukum_recent_2004}. It may therefore be particularly important to incorporate time- and temperature-dependent host rock response \parencite[e.g.,][]{gregg_catastrophic_2012} to Olympus Mons.

\section{Fundamental Limitations}

Despite the potential to apply these methods more widely, it is important to keep in mind the fundamental limitations of the discordance method which constrain its explanatory power. First, only a fraction of this or any other study area surface is covered in flows or channels whose orientation can be reliably measured. Additionally, these flows record an incomplete picture of the topographic surface upon which they were emplaced---downhill azimuth but not slope. Recent progress has been made toward independent paleo-slope estimates from lava flow morphology \parencite{wadge_lobes_1991, peitersen_correlations_2000, peters_lava_2021}, but the unique physical conditions of each terrestrial planet and difficulty in observing lava flow emplacement make it difficult to benchmark these models. Finally, only those flows which were subsequently deformed off-axis (i.e., by an offset center, or a more complex inflation system with the same net tilt axis) become discordant.

In this study, and likely in other studies focused on volcanic summit regions, most lava flows and channels are not discordant. Although these features cannot provide evidence for underling surface attitude change, they can provide evidence that such attitude change did not occur. More precisely, the azimuth of a non-discordant feature implies that any post-emplacement surface attitude change must have occurred about a perpendicular axis. This implies either a colinear (non-offset) inflation center or one sufficiently far away that the surface tilt solution approaches \ang{0} (e.g., in Figure~\ref{fig:mogi-test-shallow-oblate} with increasing distance.).

Additionally, discordant flows are not necessarily the same age as one another. This can become a problem for analysis if flows are grouped together from two eruptive periods with intervening surface deformation. The net displacement recorded by each population will correspond to different subsurface pressure change events. It will then be difficult to find a single event to explain both populations, especially if each pressure change event took place at a different location.

The most promising dating method to complement this limitation is crater counting. Important progress has been made toward constraining the timeline of Late Amazonian volcanic activity \parencite{kneissl_map-projection-independent_2011,robbins_volcanic_2011,
robbins_large_2013, platz_crater-based_2013}, although a detailed chronology is still out of reach. The difficulty inherent to the stochastic nature of this method is that small regions are difficult to date with high precision. One result from this thesis which could address this challenge is that discordant populations which are best explained by the same axisymmetric pressure change conditions are likely to have been deformed (if not emplaced) at the same time. Conversely, populations whose most likely centers differ in position and inflation energy are more likely to be stratigraphically distinct. While the method of this thesis cannot directly resolve relative ages, it could help to identify contemporaneous units and thus increase the precision of the crater counting method by expanding the area of interest.
