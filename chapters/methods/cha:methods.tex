\chapter{Methods}\label{cha:methods}

In this chapter, I first define the study area (Section~\ref{sec:study-area}) and introduce important geometric considerations (Section~\ref{sec:considerations}) which inform the derivation and implementation of each subsequent method.

Next, I introduce the surface deformation signature of a magma reservoir pressure change event (Section~\ref{sec:modeling}). I pay particular attention to representing surface displacement in terms of \emph{attitude} (orientation) change for direct comparison with topographically discordant features. The intermediate products of this section are two surface tilt solutions modeled as a function of distance from the reservoir inflation center. I use an analytical solution for preliminary inverse modeling\footnote{estimating reservoir depth and inflation energy directly from a tilt-distance dataset.} and a numerical solution for fine-tuning via forward modeling.\footnote{assessing additional parameters by their effect on predicted tilt-distance data.}

With idealized tilt solutions prepared, I construct analogous tilt-distance datasets (Section~\ref{sec:mapping}) for discordant features in the study area. I first compare the orientation of flow features (via imagery) with the surface attitude (via topography) of their surroundings. From these data I derive the first intermediate product of this section: a spatial distribution of discordant features in the study area. However, distance and tilt (for comparison with solutions from Section~\ref{sec:modeling}) each depend on the axisymmetric inflation center position. Since I do not know this position, I define an array of candidate center locations to test. For each center, I calculate a) distance from, and b) tilt implied at, each lava feature sample. The final intermediate product of this section is an array of tilt-distance datasets (one for each center candidate location) for analysis under the framework derived in Section~\ref{sec:modeling}.

Finally, I analyze and evaluate (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}) each candidate center by the degree to which its associated tilt-distance dataset (Section~\ref{sec:mapping}) aligns mathematically with a physically plausible tilt-distance solution from Section~\ref{sec:modeling}. I use the spatial distribution of these evaluation results to assess the subsurface conditions most likely responsible for discordant features at the surface.
