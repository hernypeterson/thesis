\chapter{Methods}\label{cha:methods}

In this chapter, I first introduce important geometric considerations (Section~\ref{sec:considerations}) which inform the derivation and implementation of each subsequent method.

Next, I introduce the surface deformation signature of a magma reservoir pressure change event (Section~\ref{sec:modeling}). I pay particular attention to representing surface displacement in terms of \emph{attitude} change for direct comparison with discordant features. The intermediate product of this section is a framework for predicting surface tilt as a function of distance from a reservoir inflation center---expressed directly in terms of the physical parameters of that reservoir. This framework includes a simplified analytical component for preliminary inverse modeling and a general numerical component for fine-tuning via forward modeling.

Next, I construct comparable tilt-distance datasets for the discordant features in the study area (Section~\ref{sec:mapping}). The first step in this construction is to measure the flow orientation and modern attitude for an array of sample point locations. From these data I derive the first intermediate product of this section: a spatial distribution of discordant features in the study area. However, the distance and implied tilt for each sample point depends on the location of the inflation center. Since I do not know this location, I create a large spatial array of candidate center points to test. For each center point, I calculate distance and tilt for each sample point for direct comparison with the aforementioned modeled tilt solution. The final intermediate product of this section is an array of tilt-distance datasets (one for each center candidate location) for analysis under the framework derived in Section~\ref{sec:modeling}.

Finally, I \emph{evaluate} (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}) each center point by the degree to which its associated tilt-distance dataset (Section~\ref{sec:mapping}) aligns mathematically with a physically plausible tilt-distance solution from Section~\ref{sec:modeling}. I use the spatial distribution of these evaluation results to assess the subsurface conditions most likely responsible for discordant features at the surface.
