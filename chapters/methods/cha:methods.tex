\chapter{Methods}\label{cha:methods}

% In this chapter, I first introduce important geometric considerations (Section~\ref{sec:considerations}) which inform the derivation and implementation of each subsequent method. Next, I introduce two data collection processes: mapping discordant lava features (Section~\ref{sec:mapping}) to gather surface \emph{attitude} data and numerically modeling magma reservoir pressure change (Section~\ref{sec:modeling}) to gather \emph{displacement} data. Finally, I develop a geometric framework of \emph{axisymmetric tilt} (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}) which allows direct comparison between these two datasets.

To keep this process organized, I bring all data (map-derived attitude and position, model-derived displacement and position) into a Jupyter Notebook environment using the Python programming language (version 3.10.9). Python is an open-source, general purpose language whose large library of modules make it a popular choice for scientific computing applications.

In the body of this section, I describe conceptually and graphically the sequence of computations I would perform for a single analysis. The full source code I use to implement these operations for my entire dataset is included in Appendix~\ref{app:code}.
