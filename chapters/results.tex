\section{Mapping Results}

Note: for map figures I translated the contacts feature class from SIM 3470 roughly \qty{700}{\m} to the North to align with the \ac{CTX} basemap.

Differentiated lava lows and channels do not uniformly cover the summit of Olympus Mons. Immediately beyond the caldera rim, distinguishable flows are limited mostly to the south-east (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:uphill-flows}) and north-west margins. Notably, there are essentially zero flows immediately south of the caldera, closer to the modern summit. [FIGURE of all mapped lobate lava flows]. Lava channels are more widespread than lobate flows, especially further from the caldera rim

Since the scores vary smoothly over the candidates, I show only the central contour plots to identify the lowest (best) scoring region.}%

\subsection{Inflation Center Evaluation}

Figure~\ref{fig:hugging} illustrates the degree to which estimated depth and energy parameters simply match those used to define the cutoff function.

    \caption[Sample populations for inflation center evaluation]{I use three nearby populations of lava features from which to evaluate axisymmetric pressure change candidates. I chose these because they are among the most discordant features in the summit which are not at the immediate caldera rim. For reference, the flows shown in the center of Figure~\ref{fig:uphill-flows} are included in population B.}%

    \caption[Check for envelope ``hugging'']{Evaluating inadvertent influence from the tilt envelope (Figure~\ref{fig:envelope}) on the regression. Essentially, I want to see whether calculated parameters closely ``hug'' the values set to define the shallow high-\acs{epv} Mogi tilt cutoff. This is a kernel density estimate where this ``hugging'' issue would show up as steep clusters right at 0, particularly for \acs{epv}, since depth $d$ is much more constrained. Seeing variation in \acs{epv} over several orders of magnitude is encouraging. This is also weighted by the number of samples that are actually ``tiltable.'' The best fits are hopefully on the lower end of the \acs{epv} distribution\dots}

    \caption[Population A: goodness of fit]{For population A, nonlinear regression using parameterized analytical function (Equation~\eqref{eq:mogi-tilt}) converges, i.e., successfully reaches an estimate within 80 function calls, for 10 of the 781 center candidates, all within \qty{\sim20}{\km} of the samples. The four purple circles represent those estimates where the relative error (standard deviation of estimate divided by value of estimate) of both the energy \acs{epv} and depth $d$ parameters are within a factor of ten. Scaled parameter error for the light grey circles are much higher, indicating a poor fit. Center candidates are labeled by cID, for comparison with regression results in Figure~\ref{fig:scatter-fit-a}, and the fraction ``tiltable'' (proportional to displayed values in Figure~\ref{fig:num-tiltable})}%

Colors represent the base-$10$ logarithm of the inflation energy \acs{epv} expressed in joules. Centers with black circles represent inflation (positive \acs{epv}); plain circles represent deflation (negative \acs{epv}). Estimated depths are labeled, with shallower estimates corresponding to larger circles. Nonsensical results such as negative depth reflect the capacity for a regression to converge mathematically to physically meaningless parameter estimates.}%

Black dotted lines represent the tilt envelope from Figure~\ref{fig:envelope}. Center 197 is plotted separately to illustrate that good mathematical fit can be reached even for physically implausible parameter estimates. Both figures also corroborates evidence in Figure~\ref{fig:hugging} that while the cutoff envelope constrains the data used for regression, the parameter estimates resulting from fitting that constrained dataset can vary widely.}%

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{math-fit-c.pdf}
    \caption[Population C: goodness of fit]{For population C, the regression converges for a slim majority (422) of the 781 center candidates. Almost all depth estimates reach an absolute error under 10, while energy error is mixed. Circle sizes are proportional to the number of ``tiltable'' samples included in the regression, the higher values of which are tightly concentrated around the population as for population A (Figure~\ref{fig:math-fit-a}).}%

\section{Numerical Model Fitting}

This section is time-permitting for the final draft. As I discuss in the following section, there are several issues to address before attempting to fit specific numerical model results to the identified inflation center candidates.
